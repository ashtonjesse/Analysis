# Analysis
This is a platform designed for interactive analysis of maps of electrical signals recorded using fluorescence imaging or electrode arrays in the heart. Signals can be filtered to reduce noise and then heart beats detected automatically where the curvature of the signal exceeds a user defined threshold. Signal events such as local activation or relaxation time are automatically detected based on published algorithms (e.g. steepest gradient) and isocontour maps generated by linear interpolation between adjacent recording sites. The platform was used in a 2019 study published in The Journal of Physiology available here: https://doi.org/10.1113/JP276876
