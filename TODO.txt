TODO

* Mark activation times with a button and be able to move marker
* Be able to adjust the window of a beat by selecting from the electrode trace.
* Create new figure called MapElectrodeData
	- Be able to grab an activation time and drag
	- Produce scatter plot with electrode names for all beats and be able to slide through beats

	- Has a diagram with the electrode glyphs plotted and a box around those electrodes currently shown in AnalyseSignals
	- Can select to map activation which loops through all beats and creates maps of activation with isoactivation contours
	- The map that is shown corresponds to the currently selected beat (or a slider can be used)
	- Has update button that recalculates maps based on user changes in activation times / rejected electrodes
	- Can click on brush which replots just the electrode locations and draw a square around the electrodes to select those to display in AnalyseSignals
	
	
	Update Selection is not working the second time around
